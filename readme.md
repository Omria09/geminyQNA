# GEMINIQNA

GEMINIQNA is a Python program that asks the gemini model 50 random questions from the dataset and returns the modelâ€™s success rate.

**Made in roughly 5 hours.**

# The parts (and success rates)
### PART 1: 
asking the model once and comparing the answers with the answers list.

>**success rate for 50 questions: 64%**

### PART 2: 
asking the model once and if the answer is deemed incorrect, keep asking the revised question and explanation untill it determines the result is correct.

>**success rate for 50 questions: 85%**, up to 100% depending on retry amount (currently set to 2)


### PART 2 Multithreaded:
 Same as part 2, but instead of asking the same model it asks a diffrent instance of gemini. also, invokes the questions in a threads to reduce waiting time between question and answers. also added factorial quota wait to reduce rate limit hits

>**I discontinued this part as the gemini quota block made it kinda useless, thus Its unfinished but I've kept it here if in the future Ill try the paid version**

_note_: when an instance decides the explanation is correct it will increase the correct answers _without_ comparing the the answers list again.
